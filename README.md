I make Python libraries and tools **that I wish existed** when I first started
learning about programming decades ago. I've added things over time that would
have helped me in my professional career and daily work life.

The best features I've created were either born of frustrations when dealing
with other codebases or super helpful things I discovered while solving problems
for myself.

I use these repositories as a reference for myself, but they were also written
with the intention that I could explain them to curious middle and elementary
school students.

Check out the [Learning Python 3
gist](https://gist.github.com/kenjyco/69eeb503125035f21a9d) if you are new to
Python and checkout the [base](https://github.com/kenjyco/base) and
[dotfiles](https://github.com/kenjyco/dotfiles) repos to **get yourself a pleasant
command-line development environment** (vim, tmux, git, and docker).
