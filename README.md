I help developers get the most out of open-source and the data they have access
to through safe experimentation so they can craft maintainable software that
delights customers while reducing future development headaches. I am also
empathetic to less-technical individuals and students learning how they can
build their own tools to explore their curiosities in an organized way.

I create custom developer tooling for innovative ways to interact with data,
build maintainable libraries, develop insightful reports, maximize software
delivery, and minimize technical debt. Iâ€™ve been shell scripting (Bash/Linux)
since 2004, using Python since 2007, and maintaining packages on the Python
Package Index since 2017.

  management, and testing with docker, git, and SSH
